# Quiz

**1. OOP’s is stand for ?** 

- `object oriented programming`
- `object oriented programming pillar`
- `object oriented programming system`
- `object oriented programming principles`

**Explanation:** OOP’s is a programming pattern that is built around `objects` or `entities`, so it's called `object-oriented programming` system.

**2. How many basic pillar in oops ?**

- `3`
- `4`
- `2`
- `5`

**Explanation:** there are four major pillars in oops. `Inheritance`, `Polymorphism`, `Encapsulation` and `Abstraction.`

**3. Class is a …………. Which defines some properties and behaviours.**

- `instance`
- `member`
- `function`
- `blueprint`

**Explanation:** Class is a blueprint which defines some `properties` and `behaviours.`

**4. How many types of inheritance in python ?**

- `5`
- `3`
- `7`
- `4`

**Explanation:** There are `five` types of `inheritance`. `Single` Inheritance. `Multiple` Inheritance. `Multilevel` Inheritance. `Hierarchical` Inheritance. `Hybrid` Inheritance.

**5. What is the advantage of inheritance ?**

- `Multiple form`
- `inherit property`
- `code reusability`
- `function reusability`

**Explanation:** When a derived class inherits the base class, then the derived class can access all the functionality, and the base class's code can be reused in the derived class.

**6.Which among the following best defines abstraction?**

- `Hiding the implementation`
- `Showing the important data`
- `Hiding the important data`
- `Hiding the implementation and showing only the features`

**Explanation:** It includes hiding the implementation part and showing only the required data and features to the user. It is done to hide the implementation complexity and details from the user. And to provide a good interface in programming.

**7.class is ___ abstraction.**

- `Object`
- `Logical`
- `Real`
- `Hypothetical`

**Explanation:** Class is logical abstraction because it provides a logical structure for all of its objects. It gives an overview of the features of an object.

**8.Which among the following can be viewed as combination of abstraction of data and code.**

- `class`
- `object`
- `inheritance`
- `interfaces`

**Explanation:** Class in object-oriented programming is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the data (attributes or properties) and behavior (methods) that the objects created from that class will have. By combining abstraction of data and code, a class provides a way to group related data and functionality into a single, logical unit.

**9.Encapsulation and abstraction differ as:**

- `Can be used any way`
- `Hiding and Binding respectively`
- `Binding and Hiding respectively`
- `Hiding and hiding respectively`

**Explanation:** Encapsulation is data binding, as in, we try to combine a similar type of data and functions together.Abstraction is hiding the complex code.

**10.Hiding the implementation complexity can:**

- `Provide better features`
- `Make the programming complex`
- `Provide more number of features`
- `Make the programming easy`

**Explanation:** It can make programming easy. The programming need not know how the inbuilt functions are working but can use those complex functions directly in the program. It doesn’t provide more number of features or better features.

**11.Data abstraction is nothing but the combination of ………..**

- `hiding and showing`
- `abstract class and interface`
- `unnecessary information`
- `none of the above`

**Explanation:** data abstraction is nothing but the combination of abstract class and interface. We can not create the object in the abstract class and interface.

**12.Refer the below code:**

```python
class Human:

def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
self.first_name = first_name
self.last_name = last_name
self.age = age

h001 = Human(“Abhay”, “Kashyap”, 26)
```

In the above code which will act as the object?

- `Human`
- `h001`
- `Abhay`
- `“Abhay”`

**Explanation:** Here, the Human is a class that gives the blueprint to construct the object. When the class with corresponding properties are passed into the h001 variable then the variable h001 will act as an object.

**13.In the above code self is a ____ .**

- `keyword`
- `attribute`
- `constructor`
- `reference to current instance to the class`

**Explanation:** The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.

**14.Maximum how many objects can be created using a class?**

- `Only 2`
- `1`
- `depends on the number of attribute in it`
- `Multiple`

**Explanation:** The class is just a blueprint to create an object so there is no limit in creating objects using a single class. Thus, we can create multiple objects using a single class.

**15.From the above code, which one is the constructor?**

- `class`
- `def`
- `__init__`
- `Human`

**Explanation:** A constructor is a unique function that helps in building an object out of a class. Here, using `__init__` we are assigning values to the data members of that class.
