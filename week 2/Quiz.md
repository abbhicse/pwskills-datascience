# Quiz 2

**1.Which operator is used for exponentiation in Python?**

- `*`
- `^`
- `**`
- `//`

**Explanation:** The ** operator is used for exponentiation in Python. For example, `2 ** 3` will result in `8`, as it calculates `2` raised to the power of `3`.

**2.What is the result of the following expression in Python?**

`10 % 3`

- 0
- 1
- 2
- 3

**Explanation:** The **%** operator is the modulus operator in Python, which returns the remainder when the left operand is divided by the right operand. In this case, `10` divided by `3` gives a quotient of `3` with a remainder of `1`.

**3.Which comparison operator is used to check for inequality in Python?**

- `!=`
- `==`
- `<=`
- `>=`

**Explanation:** The `!=` operator is used to check for inequality in Python. It returns `True` if the two operands are not `equal`, and `False` if they are `equal.`

**4.What is the output of the following code snippet?**

```python
x = 5
y = 2

if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
elif x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    print("x is equal to y")
```

- x is greater than y
- x is less than y
- x is equal to y
- The code will produce an error.

**Explanation:** Since `x` is greater than `y (5 > 2)`, the condition `x > y` is `True`, and the corresponding code block will be executed. Hence, the output will be `x is greater than y.`

**5.Which loop is suitable when the number of iterations is unknown in advance?**

- while loop
- for loop
- break statement
- continue statement

**Explanation:** The `while` loop is suitable when the number of iterations is unknown in advance. It repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the specified condition is `true`. The `loop` continues until the condition becomes `false.`

**6.What is the purpose of the break statement in Python?**

- It terminates the execution of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.
- It terminates the entire loop and resumes the execution from the next statement after the loop.
- It skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.
- It is used for comparing values and returning the Boolean result.

**Explanation:** The `break` statement is used to prematurely terminate a `loop`. When encountered, it immediately `exits` the `loop` and `resumes` the execution from the next statement after the `loop`.

**7.What is the output of the following code snippet?**

```python

for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```

- 0 1 3 4
- 0 1 2 3 4
- 0 1 2
- 2 3 4

**Explanation:** The code uses a `for loop` to iterate over the values from `0` to `4.`
